            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Here at Ex-Haven we believe that the word "Exotic" should only apply to the nature of the 
                    creatures we sell and not the price nor diffuculty of obtaining them. We are a marketplace 
                    made by breeders, meaning we skip the cold pet trade, and go straight for what matters; qauality
                    and care. We are a community of animal lovers and breeders who are dedicated to providing the best, and healthiest
                    specimins as well as all the equipment and knowledge needed to care for them, all in one place, and one price.
